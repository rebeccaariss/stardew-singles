# stardew-singles
Full and interactive list of marriageable NPCs from indie game [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki) (including all of the relevant character info). Designed to make the in-game dating experience frictionless and fun!

As one of my first passion projects, with this application my goal was to create the guide I've always wanted to enrich my Stardew Valley gaming experience. I wanted to consolidate all the NPC dating-related information into one centralized location as opposed to endlessly and repetitively clicking through Wiki pages to find the information I needed. [Wiki races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace) are fun and all, but that's a different game entirely. ðŸ¤“

**Version one** of this app was built to operate entirely on the front-end with React. This version includes a basic search feature for locating a singular NPC information card by character name. Cards include character images, names, bios, pronouns, birthdays, addresses, and recommended gifts as well as external links to the Stardew Valley Wiki.

*v1 search feature*

## Future updates to include:
- Back-end support (including user **authentication** with **password hashing**, save features, and multiple **endpoints**)
- Migration of character information from local *datingpool.js* file to **Postgres database**
- Additional functionality ("swipe right" functionality, "match" page, gift checklists, NPC heart/progress tracking, NPC daily schedules, NPC image galleries, chat bot, etc).
- Deployment via **Heroku** & **GitHub Pages**
- Bug fixes (including filters by gender, scrolling issues, etc).

## Nice-to-haves:
- In the future I might work on my C# skills by making this app available as a PC mod.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in contributing to this project! I would love to see this grow into something that can benefit the Stardew gaming community on a larger scale.
